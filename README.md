## Title
Foundit

## Description
Foundit is a Reddit analytics tool. Users will be able to see topline stats on Reddit subreddits and users. Stats
may include: users with the highest number of karma points, most popular subreddits, most popular threads, subreddit popularity trended over time, most popular memes, etc. We will use data visualization to display the stats on a custom website.

## Vision Statement
Identifying what is popular on Reddit. 

## Motivation
We love data and Reddit. Part of being a good Reddit user is knowing what is trending and what keeps other Reddit users engaged. By identifying which threads and posters are the most popular, when popular posts are posted, and how long a thread or meme maintains interest, we will get insights into the elements that make up popular content on Reddit.

## Risks
Format of the data and its contents are unknown.
We do not know how we will pull the data.
Some team members will be working with new languages.
No one on the team knows HTM.L
Team members are working on other projects which might lead to issues with workload.
Time estimates may be way off and we may be committing to too much.

## Mitigation Strategy
If the data appears unusable, we will use another data set.
If we cannot extract the data, we will use another data set.
If a member of the team is struggling with a specific language, they will be switched to another area of the project.
If it is too difficult to build a website from scratch, we may use a web development GUI.
If a team member's workload becomes too much, others on the team will need to pick up the slack or we will scale back the scope.
If time is an issue, we will pull back on the scope of the project (fewer stats or simpler visualizations.)
